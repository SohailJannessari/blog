I am currently an adjunct professor at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. Since 2017 I've been teaching quantitative methods courses to the undergraduate students of political science. You can find the syllabi [here](http://sohailjannessari.github.io/syllabi).

Over the last ten years I have, in different capacities, collaborated with all sorts of media outlets around the world, from proofreading for Persian media to being interviewed about covid situation by CBC, to writing op-eds for Catarsi magazin here in Catalonia. You can find some of my journalistic work [here](http://sohailjannessari.github.io/media).

Most of my work is focused on quantitative studies of elections and parties, but I also dabble in international relations from time to time.
