title: 'Pezeshkian offers breathing room in Iran but...'

<body dir=ltr align="justify">
I wrote for <i> The Left Berlin</i> on Iran's recent presidential election, the new President Pezeshkian, and the Left:

"It’s a big task to revive and rebuild what’s lost, especially with privatizers and business interests around the government. Pezeshkian, a medical practitioner himself, kept talking against privatization in the health and education sectors. That alone would be a major step. One could wish that the Islamic Republic in general and the Reformists in particular have learned their lesson. One may remember all the withered wishes.
...
Pezeshkian’s lack of ambitious, or even concrete, programs during the campaign was so apparent that he was criticized for it by both Jalili and those who boycotted the elections, and his own supporters too. He kept insisting on unity and reconciliation and referring to various limitations here and there. He envisages a technocratic government on good terms with all power centers, with vague promises of improvements."
