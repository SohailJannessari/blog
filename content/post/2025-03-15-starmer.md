title: 'Mesmerized by a chart'
---
<body dir=ltr align="justify">
Few nights ago I made this chart and video with data from Chap Hill Expert Survey, 1999-2019 and 2004 data sets (Downloadable <a href="https://www.chesdata.eu/ches-europe"> here</a>).

I have watched it maybe 500 times already. Labour Party's movements are so amazing, from Blair's first government to Corbyn's Great Leap Leftward to Starmer's retraction.

This is everything.
