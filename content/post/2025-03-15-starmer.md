title: 'Mesmerized by a chart'
---
<body dir=ltr align="justify">
Few nights ago I made this chart and video with data from Chap Hill Expert Survey, 1999-2019 and 2024 data sets (Downloadable <a href="https://www.chesdata.eu/ches-europe"> here</a>). To make it easier to present, I took some liberties, e.g. lumping up Farage parties (Reform, Brexit, and UKIP) together but still keeping the name Reform.

I have watched it maybe 500 times already. Labour Party's movements are so self-explanatory, from Blair's first government to Corbyn's Great Leap Leftward to Starmer's cowardly retraction of it.

This, to me, is everything.
